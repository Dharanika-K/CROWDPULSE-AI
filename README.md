CrowdPulse AI
AI-Based Civic Issue Monitoring System
📖 Project Overview

CrowdPulse AI is a full-stack web application designed to collect and analyze civic issues reported by citizens. The system uses Artificial Intelligence (Sentiment Analysis) to classify public complaints as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

This project demonstrates the integration of:

Frontend (React.js)

Backend (FastAPI)

AI Sentiment Analysis

REST API Communication

🎯 Objective

To build an intelligent civic issue reporting system that:

Allows users to submit public complaints

Performs real-time sentiment analysis

Displays results dynamically

Demonstrates full-stack development with AI integration

📝 User Stories

As a citizen, I want to submit a civic issue report with my location and description so that the authorities are aware of the problem.
As a system administrator, I want the system to automatically analyze the sentiment of the submitted report so that issues can be prioritized based on severity.
As a user, I want to see a confirmation and the analyzed sentiment of my report so that I know my complaint was successfully processed.
As a developer, I want the frontend and backend to communicate via REST APIs so that the application is modular and scalable.

🚀 How to Run the Project
🔹 Step 1: Backend Setup (FastAPI)
1️⃣ Navigate to backend folder
cd backend
2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
python -m venv venv

Activate:

Windows:

venv\Scripts\activate
3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install fastapi uvicorn

(Install additional ML libraries if used)

4️⃣ Enable CORS (Important)

Make sure your main.py contains:

from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
5️⃣ Run Backend Server
uvicorn main:app --reload

Backend will run at:

http://127.0.0.1:8000

Swagger Docs available at:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
🔹 Step 2: Frontend Setup (React)
1️⃣ Navigate to frontend folder
cd frontend
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
npm install

If axios is not installed:

npm install axios
3️⃣ Start React App
npm start

Frontend will run at:

http://localhost:3000
🔗 API Endpoint
POST /report

  "issue": "Potholes",
  "description": "Road is completely damaged and unsafe."
}

Response Example:

{
